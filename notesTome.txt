if you are first time download pipx you need to restart your program
if you are not initilizae the system first time (opening pcb layout and schematic) configure paths etc not work because sym-lib and fp-lib is not created yet
Maybe you can split bash files into two for installing pip and installing easyeda2kicad and other files
